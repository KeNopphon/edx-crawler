Core (Depth 2900-6400 km, Pressure 136-364 GPa, Density 9.9-13 g/cm3) Outer core (Depth 2900-5150 km, Pressure 136-329 GPa, Density 9.9-12.2 g/cm3) At the depth of 2900 km, there exists a core-mantle boundary. At a depth 2900-5150 km, there is the outer core made of iron, nickel and other light elements. It is liquid, and in order for convection to occur, it is believed to have a homogeneous chemical composition. The core’s convection provides the earth with its magnetic field. The speed is said to be the same as the walking speed of people, and a cylindrical flow surrounds the core. Due to the dynamo effect (electromagnetic induction), the earth’s magnetic field is formed. This protects life on Earth from the dangerous solar wind and cosmic rays.   Further study: Dynamo theory https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_theory   Inner core (Depth 5150-6400 km, Pressure 329-363 GPa, Density 12.7-13.1 g/cm3) At 5150 km below ground, we finally arrive at the earth’s deepest part, the inner core. Similar to the outer core, it is thought to be made of metals, predominantly iron. However, it is a solid. Surprisingly, we know that it is rotating faster than the surface of the earth and that the nature differs under the Western and Eastern hemisphere. In addition, there is a theory where the dynamo’s flow is adjusted and a strong magnetic field is formed due to the existence of an inner core.    There are still a lot of mysteries surrounding the earth’s core.  For example, What is the core temperature? →Week 4 What are light elements? →Week 3, 5 (There are plenty more questions …) We will touch upon them now and then in the future. I touched on convection at the end of the lecture. Next week, when we determine the earth’s temperature structure, we will look at it in detail in the video. Look forward to it!
