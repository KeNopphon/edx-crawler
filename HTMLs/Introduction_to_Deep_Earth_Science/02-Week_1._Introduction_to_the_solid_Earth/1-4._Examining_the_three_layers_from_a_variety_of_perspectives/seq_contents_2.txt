Mantle (Depth 30-2900 km, Pressure 0.6-136 GPa, Density 3.4-5.6 g/cm3) Under the earth’s crust lies the mantle. *This boundary is called the Moho (Mohorovicic discontinuity). It is the surface observed at the ophiolite (Week 1-2-2). The mantle is a large rocky area. After the earth’s crust ends, the mantle spreads up to 2900 km below ground.  Here, I will only explain what type of layers are in the mantle and what type of minerals they are made of. I will touch on the rest in weeks 2 and 3.   Upper Mantle (Depth 30-410 km, Pressure 0.6-13 GPa, Density 3.4-3.5 g/cm3) Firstly, to the depth of 410 km from the base of the crust is the upper mantle. This can be inferred from the xenoliths that I mentioned earlier. Surprisingly, most of the upper mantle consists of just one type of rock, the peridotite. However, there is something even more interesting. What is the main mineral of this peridotite? Surprisingly, it is the gem peridot. The yellow-green minerals are sold in jewelry stores as a July birthstone. (Relatively clean, surprisingly cheap.) Peridotite has a density of about 3.3 g/cm3. Compared to the rocks that make up the earth’s crust, it is rather heavy. Isn’t it lovely that the interior of our earth is actually filled with gems?  Further study: I have been casually writing the word ‘minerals’ all this while, but it is necessary to define it properly. Minerals refer to substances that exist in nature that have regular crystal structures. They are pure substances. On the other hand, rocks are aggregations of minerals. The combination of minerals give them their characteristics. In other words, they are mixed substances.   Further study: Peridotites contain a variety of minerals such as olivine and pyroxene. In addition, rocks other than peridotites also exist in the lower mantle in reality.   Transition zone (Depth 410-660 km, Pressure 13-24 GPa, Density 3.7-4.0 g/cm3) If you continue digging into the earth, you will hit the next layer at 410 km below ground. The main minerals changes from olivine to what is called wadsleyite. If you go deeper, at 550 km the minerals change from wadsleyite to the mineral called ringwoodite. However, this boundary layer at 550 km does not really stand out in the seismic wave observation.   Lower mantle (Depth 660-2700 km, Pressure 24-127 GPa, Density 4.4-5.5 g/cm3) The next seismologically obvious boundary is located at 660 km. This layer is primarily made up of ferropericlase and silicate perovskite. The lower mantle continues from 660 km below ground to approximately 2700 km and takes up around 60% of the earth’s volume.   D” layer (Depth 2700-2900 km, Pressure127-136 GPa, Density 5.5-5.6 g/cm3)  In between the outer core and the lower mantle’s boundary surface is a thin layer of around 200 km called the D” layer. This layer has a large seismic wave difference from the upper mantle and has received much interest as the mystery layer. In 2004, the main mineral of this layer was found in the Hirose laboratory. That is the post-perovskite layer. In Week 1-4-5, we will cover this post-perovskite layer in detail. Before that, let’s look at Week 1-4-4 about the experimental techniques and high pressure experiments that led to the discovery of this layer in detail again.
