            "Hi I am Yoshiyuki , one of the TAs of this course.",
            "and I am Haruka. I am also one of TAs.",
            "Today, we will introduce a simple experiment to observe the differences between the the longitudinal wave and the transverse wave.",
            "I think You can do this experiment in your house too, so please try.",
            "Today, we will conduct experiments using this device.",
            "In week1, we learned that we are exploring the Earth&#39;s interior using seismic wave.",
            "And we also learned that the seismic wave has P-wave, which is a longitudinal wave and S-wave, which is a transverse wave.",
            "So, let\u2019s look at the two waves using this device.",
            "First, it is the longitudinal wave, P-wave.",
            "Do you see that dense section is moving in the same direction as the traveling direction of the wave?",
            "Let&#39;s try again.",
            "Next is the transverse wave, S-wave.",
            "This time, movement of the weights is vertical to the traveling direction of the wave.",
            "I&#39;ll try again.",
            "Well, let&#39;s then focus on the differences in the speed of P-wave and S-wave.",
            "First, it is the P-wave.",
            "Next is the S-wave.",
            "You can see that the P- wave is faster than the S- wave.",
            "In this way, generally, P- wave is faster than S- wave.",
            "This is the same even in the case of seismic waves.",
            "longitudinal wave arrives earlier than transverse wave, so that\u2019s why we call longitudinal wave as Primary Wave = P wave,",
            "P wave",
            "and transverse wave arrives next,so we call transverse wave Secondary Wave.",
            "S wave",
            "Next, in the case of seismic waves, P-wave and S-wave would transmit at the same time.Let&#39;s see how the 2 waves go transmitted.",
            "Please see one more.",
            "wave\u2019s velocity depends on the composition and state of material which wave travels through.",
            "Also, in Japan, When an earthquake occurs, by capturing the P wave that reaches first, we predict a more big shake, that is S wave. This will minimize the damage caused by earthquakes.",
            "The difference between the P-wave and S-wave has been useful in various places, not only to explore the interior of the Earth.",
            "Thank you very much. Bye."
