The three important parameters used in DES Part1 are as follows. 1) Pressure 2) Temperature 3) Material (Chemical composition)  : What types of elements are in what state?  Paying attention to these three parameters will greatly aid your understanding in each part of the course. At this point I will provide some information that is meaningful for polishing your sense for pressure and temperature.   1. Temperature The temperatures dealt with in DES (in the range of 1000K to 7000K) are vastly greater than the surface temperature that you are all experiencing now. Just how high do you think this temperature is? Let’s start with a candle’s flame. The red part is about 1000K (±200K). So what about the temperature of magma flowing on the surface? This is also a little higher than 1000K. Iron’s melting point, which most people imagine is hot, does not exceed 1800K. (Iron evaporates at 3400K).The surface temperature of the sun is about 6000K. It defies our senses, but I think you understand that it is quite hot.    2. Pressure What is the pressure in the earth interior? The pressure at the center of the earth is 364GPa. It cannot be intuitively grasped. Now extend the palm of your hand. If you were to place about 100 Tokyo Towers, a symbolic Tokyo building, on top of your palm, you would reach this pressure. I’m not sure that helped you understand… This pressure is also equivalent to stacking around 10 million cars on top of a small coin (penny of 1 yen coin.) Now I think you are all wondering how we know about the inside of the earth, especially which the pressure is 364 GPa. That’s the topic of the next chapter. Let’s move on!
