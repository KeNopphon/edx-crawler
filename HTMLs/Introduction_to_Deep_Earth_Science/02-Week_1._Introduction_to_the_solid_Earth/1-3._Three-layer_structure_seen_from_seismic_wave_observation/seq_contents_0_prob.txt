    CHALLENGE!
    
    We learned about the characteristics of P-wave and S-wave. This is a simple computational problem about these 2 waves.
    
    An earthquake which occurred in Japan has observed at the North Pole. In such a case, how long is the gap between the arrival of the first P-wave and S-wave?
    
    P-waves travel at 13 km/s and S-waves travel at 7 km/s. Both waves are deemed to travel in a straight line through the interior of Earth.
    
    The latitude of Japan is 30Â° North. Assume the Earth as a perfect sphere with a radius of 6,400 km.
