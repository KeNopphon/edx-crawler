Japan is an earthquake superpower. The March 11, 2011 Tohoku earthquake should still be fresh in your memories. The damage from the earthquake and subsequent tsunami resulted in more than 18000 dead and missing persons, and economic damage of 25 trillion yen. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Tōhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami Earthquakes occur due to the movement of faults. A fault is a gap in the surface. The accumulation of deformations in the earth cause existing faults to shift, and earthquakes to occur. The movement of a fault is the "focus" or "hypocenter" , and the waves that propagate from here are the “earthquake.”  If you would like to know more about the Earthquake, please visit the USGS website below.http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/earthq1/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/kids/eqscience.php The discipline concerning earthquakes is vast. The various fields range from seismology and tsunamis to disaster prevention and social science. However, DES focuses on how earthquakes tell us about the earth interior, and that is what we will delve into. * I would like to express my condolences to the victims of the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, and respect to the people still struggling in the disaster area, with wounds unhealed. I would also like to express thanks for the support from all over the world.
