You can also “see” the earth interior in three dimensions as if looking at the inside of a pregnant woman’s stomach. The following image shows the result. Obtaining seismic wave tomography can be compared to solving simultaneous equations. Seismographs are set up at various positions on the earth’s surface. When an earthquake occurs at a certain spot, the underground information on the earthquake from the hypocenter to the seismographs is saved as the transmission velocity. The velocity profile of seismic wave (a) can thus be obtained. By synthesizing it with the velocity profile obtained from another earthquake (b), this mechanism indicates at what underground sections the seismic wave velocity changes. (The result is quite delicate.) The speed with which seismic waves propagate depends on the temperature within the earth. The lower the temperature, the faster seismic waves propagate (in other words, the area has not expanded due to heat as much as the surroundings, and the density is high), but the higher the temperature, the slower seismic waves propagate (in other words, the area has expanded due to heat more than the surroundings, and the density is low.) The development of tomography has led to much new knowledge of the earth interior.  Are you interested in more details of Seismic Tomography?
