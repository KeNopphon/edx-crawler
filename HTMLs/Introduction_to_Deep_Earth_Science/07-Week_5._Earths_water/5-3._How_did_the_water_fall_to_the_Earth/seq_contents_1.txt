What the early Earth was like, is a great question of Earth Science. Earth’s formation was 4.6 billion years ago. Scientists consider that almost all of -- or majority part of -- the Earth was molten at that time because of the collision of planetesimals to the Earth. We called it "Magma-Ocean". After this period, inside of the Earth, crystallisation of ;minerals occurred. At that time, chemical components partitioned to the early atmosphere, the early ocean, the early crust, the early mantle and the early core. They could be different from counterparts of today's the Earth. There are so many interesting topics geoscientists should challenge. In order to understand the origin of life, we need information about the environment of the early Earth. For example, what kind of elements were in the early atmosphere, ocean and crust? How high the temperature of the Earth was? Where the life was born? The emergence of Earth's life was around 4 billion years ago,only 0.6 billion years after the Earth was formed. Unfortunately we can find few geological evidences at that period because almost all early rocks have disappeared from the recent Earth's surface. We need to take a bottom up approach, which means that we should consider the how the Earth was formed to solve the question about the origin of life. Therefore, understanding chemical partitioning in whole the early Earth is really important and Deep Earth Science has a important roll.
