In this week you will learn about the Earth’s water. Here are the learning objectives for this week. Upon the completion of this week’s units, you will be able to; explain about water inside the Earth in addition to the oceans. Welcome to Week 5. This is at last, the final week for DES. I hope that you have all enjoyed yourselves. Thank you for participating in the class.  I hope that you will feel free to post notes about anything that is difficult to understand in this text or any omissions on the discussion board. You can contribute to future class participants by doing so.  Now, week 5 will be a bit different from up to now. In this section we will mobilize what we have learned up to now to look into the issue of how much water there is on Earth. The content here has yet to be written in textbooks (and is still being debated among scientists). Rather than for the sake of acquiring new knowledge, please accept this in the spirit of experiencing how scientists are thinking about what and what is going on in the vanguard of science.  There are few materials this week in that connection. On the other hand, there will be a report at the end. Put what you have learned to work and don’t hesitate to try and create a report that will make people stop and think when they read it. The reports will be evaluated by peer review.  Okay, let’s begin our final week, Week 5.
