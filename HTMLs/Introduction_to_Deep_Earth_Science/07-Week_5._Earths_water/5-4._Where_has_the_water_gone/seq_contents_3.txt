 We know that exoplanets orbit around stars, like Earth, Mars, and Venus around the sun. In particular, we know that there are exoplanets like Earth that can support life. The place where planets that can support life exist is called the Habitable Zone, and we studied this in Notes 5-4-2. So where are these planets that are similar to Earth? Let me introduce an interesting research (Tian and Ida, 2015) that was done recently. They researched conditions that allow liquid water to exist on the planet’s surface in addition to an ocean-continent ratio of approximately 1:1, namely planets with similar conditions to Earth. The importance of the ocean-continent ratio to life is highlighted in this week’s lecture. They did a simulation on what type of planets are formed around stars of 0.3, 0.5 and 1.0 times the mass of the Sun and then on how much water those planets can obtain and maintain. As a result, they discovered that at 1.0 times the Sun’s mass, i.e. around stars similar to the Sun, planets form that have environments similar to Earth.
