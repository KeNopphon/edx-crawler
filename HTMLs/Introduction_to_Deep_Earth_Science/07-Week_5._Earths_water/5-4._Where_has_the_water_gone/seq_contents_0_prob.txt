 Quiz a
 
    About how much water (hydrogen) is contained in the core compared with the amount of sea water?
    

       Nearly the same amount of sea water
       

       80 times of sea water
       

       800 times of sea water
       

       1/80 times of sea water

    Inclusions in diamonds from the mantle transition zone (under 410 to 660 km from the surface of the Earth) was found to contain 1.0 wt% of water. Suppose that this value represents the water content of this transition zone. It is estimated that the density of the mantle transition zone is \(3.5 [g/cm^3]\) and the volume of the mantle transition zone is approximately \(1.1*10^{11} [km^3] \). In this case, how much water is contained in the transition zone compared to the water contained in the ocean?
    
    Note: Total water contained in the ocean is approximately \(2.0*10^{24} [g] \)
    
     [kg]
    
    . (We are very sorry that the unit of the ocean's mass was wrong.)
