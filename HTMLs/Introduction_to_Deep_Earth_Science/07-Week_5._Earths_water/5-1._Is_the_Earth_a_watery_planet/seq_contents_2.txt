From dozens of years ago, the imaginations of scientists and authors have been occupied by the idea of exoplanets; in other words, planets orbiting stars other than the Sun. However, the existence of exoplanets was only scientifically confirmed in 1995 (exactly 20 years ago in October!), shortly before the beginning of the 21st century. The discovered exoplanet, later given the name "Hot Jupiter," bears no resemblance to planets in our solar system. Hot Jupiter is a gas giant which resembles Jupiter and orbits a mere 0.05 AU from the central star. This close proximity exerts perturbation on the central star and the resulting vibration was observed as a Doppler effect of light. Since this initial discovery, thousands of exoplanets have been observed, a number which greatly exceeded initial expectations. However, the discovery of these planets is completely attributable to the growth and advancement of observation technology. This article gives a simple introduction of methods which have been devised and developed for observing exoplanets.  This is the first method used to successfully observe exoplanets orbiting a main-sequence star. Unlike the Sun, planets do not emit bright light and are very dark. Therefore, instead of directly observing planets, the existence of many exoplanets has been confirmed indirectly by observing the effect of those planets on the central star. The Doppler shift method observes a Doppler shift in light arriving from the central star. This Doppler shift is caused when the planet interacts with the central star (imagine how the body of a hammer thrower is swung around). Put simply, when the central star in question is moving in the direction of the observer, the light wavelength is shortened and changes to a blue color. On the other hand, when the central star is moving away from the observer, the light wavelength is elongated and changes to a red color. The weight of the planet and distance from the central star can be estimated from this periodic vibration of the wavelength.   2) Transit Method Together with the Doppler shift method, the transit method is one of the most effective methods of observation. In the transit method, observation is conducted for the phenomenon of a temporary decrease in brightness of the central star occurring when the exoplanet passes between the central star and the observer (namely, the Earth). This size of the exoplanet is determined based on the rate of decrease in brightness.            3) Direct Observation Method In recent years, improvements in observation technology (in particular, technology for "hiding" excessively-bright central stars) have made it possible to roughly view the actual form of exoplanets. For example, the Subaru Telescope located on the summit of Mauna Kea in Hawaii can capture the form of planets which reflect the light of central stars. The image on the right was released in 2009 and shows what are thought to be two planets (B and C) orbiting GJ758 (http://subarutelescope.org).©NAOJ   4) Microlensing Method When a planet cuts in front of a light source such as a star, the light passing through the area which is warped by gravity surrounding the planet is collected as if through the lens. As a result, light becomes stronger for just an instant. The microlensing method uses this phenomenon to observe exoplanets. Although this method is capable of observing solitary floating planets (or unknown substance the size of planets!?) drifting through space, it is not possible to observe the same planet again.      5) Astrometry Method The astrometry method is probably the oldest method proposed for observing exoplanets. This method uses the simple principle of confirming a shift in the position of the celestial sphere of a star which is orbiting planets. From the early 20th century, this method was frequently used in attempts to search for exoplanets. However, all such attempts ended in vain. There is no room in this article to discuss the drama surrounding the first discovery of exoplanets. In 2009, the observation of an exoplanet using this method was reported. 6) Pulsar Timing Method Pulsars are neutron stars which revolve at high speeds. As implied by their name, pulsars periodically emit electromagnetic waves in the form of pulses. Normally, the pulse cycle is extremely stable. However, when there is a planet in the vicinity of the pulsar, this cycle is disturbed by gravitational effects. In 1992, this method was used to discover a planet orbiting a pulsar, a finding which came in advance of the discovery of planets surrounding main-sequence stars.
