We now know that there are various types of exoplanets (Notes 5-1-2). However, since direct confirmation by going to these exoplanets is not possible, how do we know that there are many types of exoplanets? There are two main methods for discovering exoplanets (Notes 5-1-3), the transit method and the Doppler method. The transit method observes the phenomenon where the observed brightness of the central star from Earth temporarily drops when the exoplanet crosses in front of its central star. The fading rate of the central star will then be known and the size of the exoplanet that will cross the star again is inferred. NASA’s space telescope, the Kepler, has discovered more than 1,000 exoplanets using this transit method. On the other hand, the Doppler method confirms the existence of exoplanets using the phenomenon where the exoplanet shakes its central star. This ‘wobble’ determines the distance between the central star and the exoplanet and their masses. In other words, after an exoplanet is observed through the transit method, the planet’s size and mass can be known by using the Doppler method for further observations. Once the size and mass is known, the exoplanet’s composition and internal structure ought to become known. Indeed, some observations show that there are many exoplanaets composed by a lot of water. Corresponding to those “water-rich” exoplanets, our Earth has small amount of water. In this sense, we can not call our Earth as “the watery planet”.
