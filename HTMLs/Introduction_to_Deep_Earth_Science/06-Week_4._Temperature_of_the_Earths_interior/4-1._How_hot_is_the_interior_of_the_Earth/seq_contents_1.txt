What is temperature? Have you considered it before? How is it different from heat? Here, we will describe temperature simply while comparing it with heat. Many of you may have thought, "Heat and temperature? Aren't they the same?" But take note that they are different things, as we will now describe. Simply put, heat is energy, and temperature is a quantitative index or measure on how hot or cold something is hot or cold.  When objects at different temperatures are in contact with one another, heat transfers from the one with the higher temperature to the lower, to try to make both the same temperature. Once they are at the same temperature, there is no more observable heat transfer. This condition is specially called "equilibrium." Strictly speaking, temperature and energy are also related. Things, looking at them in minute detail, are made up of atoms and molecules. Those atoms and molecules are not visible to the eye, but we know that they gain energy and are making fine movements (thermal motion). Temperature is the measurement indicating how vigorous the thermal motion is, and heat is the process of transmitting energy. Explaining things in this vicinity can get a little complicated. Look into statistical thermodynamics for further information.  Thinking about this in relation to the Earth, the surface is cold, the temperature rises in the interior with increasing depth, and the temperature is very high at the center of the Earth. It follows that heat naturally tries to transfer from areas of high temperature to low, namely, from the interior of the Earth to the exterior. There are three mechanisms of heat transfer in this: conduction, convection, and radiation. We will discuss this in 4-2.  Let's look deeper into the heat of the interior of the Earth in 4-3, 4-4!
