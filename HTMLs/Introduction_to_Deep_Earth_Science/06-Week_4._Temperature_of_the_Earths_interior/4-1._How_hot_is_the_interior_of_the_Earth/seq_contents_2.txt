There are over 20,000 hot spring facilities in Japan, and many Japanese enjoy bathing in onsen. Some hot spring facilities are also lodging facilities, hosting over 100,000,000 overnight guests a year. Literature from around the seventh century contain accounts about onsen, so we can see that the Japanese have been enjoying onsen since long ago. Today, hot springs are enjoyed in a variety of ways by the Japanese, from toji, medical treatment and rest at hot springs, to recreational use. In recent times, hot spring facilities are not limited to areas traditionally known for onsen, but ones in urban areas are increasing, using hot springs sourced by drilling to a depth of around 1,000 m. Why not casually try onsen while in Japan?
