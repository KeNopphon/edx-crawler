 Determination of light elements is one of the hot issues in high-pressure geoscience. Next graph shows the number of the publications for each light element(s). Horizontal axis represents year when published, and vertical axis shows the total number of papers published in the year. In this way, you can see this problem is still under discussion. To explain this density deficit with only one light element, following amount of them should be in the core. Solving the issue of light elements in the core may be clues to more profound problems such as Earth's composition, Earth's origin, and the beginning of lives! Please look forward to next week and you will learn about light elements inside the core included cutting-edge research topics! We introduce SPring-8 to you through a field work in this week because this facility is a really powerful tool to solve these basic questions based upon research results. So, after you finish the quiz, let's go to the fieldwork, "Field trip to SPring-8"!!
