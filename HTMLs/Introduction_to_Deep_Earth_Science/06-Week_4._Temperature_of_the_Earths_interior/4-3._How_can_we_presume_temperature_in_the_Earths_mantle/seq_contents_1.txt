Now, let us examine the phase diagram of peridotite, the main material of the Earth's upper mantle. The simplified phase diagram of peridotite is shown below. The solidus is the curve indicating the temperature at which the substance begins to melt when the temperature of the substance is raised. In other words, it indicates the temperature at which all parts of the substance becomes solid when the temperature is lowered. The liquidus is the curve indicating the temperature at which the substance completely melts when the temperature of the substance is raised. In other words, it is the temperature at which the solid phase first begins when the temperature of the melted substance is lowered. You may be thinking about how, with ice and water, when the pressure is determined, the phase transition temperature between liquid and solid is unambiguous, and perhaps you maybe wondering why solidus and liquidus exist. This is because peridotite is not a pure substance. In other words, the composition of peridotite cannot be described in one simple chemical formula. "Peridotite" is a mixture made up of many components. In this way, when substances including many components are made to melt, there is a gap (the red area in the figure) between the temperatures where melting begins and ends.  The phase diagram of peridotite can be determined through high pressure experiment. (This is determined unrelated to the actual temperature of the Earth's interior.) Let us find the temperature of the Earth's interior by comparing it with its pressure—that is what we will discuss next.
