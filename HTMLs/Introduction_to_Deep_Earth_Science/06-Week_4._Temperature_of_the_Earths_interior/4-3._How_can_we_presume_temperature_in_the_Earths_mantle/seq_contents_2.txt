The phase diagram of olivine, the major mineral of peridotite, is as shown below. The change in phases of olivine are as shown below.   Further Study:  A portion of the Mg content in olivine can be replaced by Fe, this is called substitution. The amount of Fe changes olivine's phase diagram and its physical properties.  To summarize the method for determining the fixed point of temperature of the Earth's interior: (1) By determining the chemical composition and repeating high pressure experiments, a phase diagram of minerals can be determined. Once the composition is determined, the phase diagram can be determined independent of the temperature and pressure conditions in the Earth's interior. (2) By observing seismic waves, the boundaries of layers inside the Earth's interior can be determined. Additionally, depth and pressure correspond in the Earth's interior. (3) On the phase transition boundary on the phase diagram, we can mark the point corresponding to boundaries of layers of the Earth. (As described in 1-1-5, when either P or T is determined in addition to the composition, the other becomes determined.) This means that, by reading the temperature associated with this point, we can know the temperature at that depth.
