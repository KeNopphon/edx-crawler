Below is the phase diagram of 4-3-2, with the addition of temperature profile near the plate and mantle boundary (red and blue curves).   Let us summarize the content of the video in this session. Mantle is solid, so the the temperature of the earth at a certain point must be lower than the solidus of peridotite.—(1) : The green arrow  We are able to observe the rise in temperature near the Earth's surface. Since heat is transferred by conduction near the surface, the geothermal gradient (thermal gradient of the Earth's interior) is extremely steep.—(2) : The red line  If this were to continue, the solidus curve and the temperature  of the Earth's interior would meet at a point. However, as you already studied in the previous section 4-2, in the Earth's interior, past a certain depth, convection of rocks is occurring. In areas where convection is occurring, the geothermal gradient would be a relatively gentle slope—(3) : The blue line , thus fulfill (1).
