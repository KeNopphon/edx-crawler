 Q1
 
   This figure represents a geotherm from the surface to outer core in the Earth. Choose a mechanism dominating the heat transportation in each region (1.red, 2.yellow, 3.green, and 4.blue).
   
   1. red region
   
 
   2. yellow region
   
 
   3. green region
   
 
   4. blue region
   
 
 Q2
 
    How fast are the mantle rocks moving with the convection?
    

       0 cm (not moving)
       

       a few centimeters to a few tens of centimeters per year
       

       a few meters to a few tens of meters per year
       

       a few kilometers to a few tens of kilometers per year
       
 Q3
 
    Choose the reason that gives the best explanation why we can assume that convection occurs in the outer core?
    

       The Earth has a magnetic field
       

       Meteorites often fall to the Earth
       

       Convection occurs in the lower mantle
       

       The Earth has volcanic activity
       
 Q4
 
   According to the lecture, the temperature at the CMB is estimated to be 3000 K~3600 K. How can we constrain these temperatures?
   
   1. 3600 K
   

       The temperature has NOT to be over the melting point of lower mantle.
       

       The temperature has to be over the melting point of lower mantle.
       

       The temperature has to be over the melting point of outer core.
       

       The temperature has NOT to be over the melting point of outer core.
       
   2. 3000 K
   

       The temperature has NOT to be over the melting point of lower mantle.
       

       The temperature has to be over the melting point of lower mantle.
       

       The temperature has to be over the melting point of outer core.
       

       The temperature has NOT to be over the melting point of outer core.
