 Heat energy can be transported in three ways: radiation, conduction, and convection.   -Radiation-    Radiation is the movement of energy by electromagnetic waves (light), without using media. It can transfer heat in vacuums.  -Conduction- Conduction is the phenomenon in which the heat energy of atoms transfer from areas of high temperature to low. The result is that the energy which had been in the high-temperature atom (vibrating rapidly) decreases, and increases the strength of vibration of the low-temperature atom. Conduction is a phenomenon in which only energy is transferred, without movement of the medium. For example, when you touch a hot pot, you feel that it is hot! This is because the heat energy in the metal of the pot transferred to the lower-temperature surface of your hand, and the heat energy in the molecules in your hand increased.  -Convection- On the other hand, convection transfers heat by transporting the medium which has the heat. Conduction occurs while convection is occurring, but convection can transfer a much greater amount of heat than conduction.Â   In the Earth, heat is moving from the core, with the highest temperature, to cold outer space. In considering heat transport inside the Earth, heat transport by radiation is considered to be very extraordinarily small compared to conduction and convection, so conduction and convection are the major mechanisms of heat transport.  The method of heat transfer determines the temperature distribution of the Earth's interior, especially its temperature gradient. Where convection is occurring, heat is transported rapidly, so the temperature difference is comparatively small. In other words, the temperature gradient (how much the temperature rises according to depth) is small. On the other hand, with conduction, the temperature gradient is steep, and temperature changes radically with a small change in depth.
