Here, to illustrate thermal convection, we present an experiment for observation, using miso soup, a traditional Japanese soup. EquipmentGlass cup, miso soup (or any liquid with powder), hot water  Further Study: This flow is famous in fluid dynamics, and is called the "Rayleigh–Bénard convection." Look into it if it interests you. The index called Rayleigh number mentioned here is a very important element, also in researching convection in the Earth's interior.
