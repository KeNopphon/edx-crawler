            "So professor, what area of research are you most interested in right now?",
            "I think that would be experimenting with liquids under high pressure.",
            "I am very interested in seeing how they behave under such conditions.",
            "Compared to solids, experimenting with liquids is extremely difficult.",
            "With solids for example, you can easily find things like density using methods like X-ray diffraction.",
            "With liquids, it&#39;s extremely difficult to find constant density at any given moment.",
            "Liquids are a lot more compressible than solids, so their properties change rapidly with pressure.",
            "So the first thing I&#39;m interested in is how liquids behave under high pressure.",
            "In terms of geoscience,",
            "when our Earth was first formed, for instance,",
            "it was a magma ocean.",
            "But now, it is solid mantle.",
            "But if you think back, it was all molten.",
            "So what was happening inside that magma ocean?",
            "Maybe it is not just about our primordial Earth, but also related to what is going on now.",
            "Our Earth&#39;s core, even now, is still liquid.",
            "I hope to see what was happening inside it.",
            "That&#39;s why I want to understand how liquids behave under high pressure.",
            "Things like the primordial magma ocean, or the liquid core which we now call the outer core:",
            "I hope to further our understanding of such things.",
            "Thank you."
