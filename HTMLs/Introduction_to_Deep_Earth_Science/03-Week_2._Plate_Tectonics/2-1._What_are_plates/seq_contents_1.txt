  This week's theme is plate tectonics, a subject which deals with the movement of the Earth's surface.   In Week 1, we learned that the Earth is divided into three main layers. These layers are classified by differences in chemical composition (this will be studied in detail in Week 3). However, plates are defined strictly by differences in hardness; in other words, differences in viscosity. It should be noted that there is no difference in composition. When classifying the Earth's surface by differences in hardness, hard sections which do not possess fluidity are called the “lithosphere,” while relatively soft sections possessing fluidity are called the “asthenosphere.”   The following figure summarizes these differences in chemical composition and viscosity.     Stated differently, the hard lithosphere floats on the soft asthenosphere. This hard lithosphere (plates) is broadly divided into 14 to 15 plates, each one of which moves independently.
