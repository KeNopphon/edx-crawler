Substances which are attracted to magnets and possess magnetic force themselves are called “ferromagnetics.” Substances classified as ferromagnetics include ferrite, iron, cobalt, nickel, and related alloys.   At the end of the 1800s, the French physicist Pierre Curie discovered that ferromagnetics lose their magnetism when reaching a certain temperature. This temperature is known as the “Curie Temperature” and differs for each ferromagnetic substance. It is known that placing ferromagnetics in an environment with a magnetic field will cause the ferromagnetics to become magnetized. Igneous rock contains iron oxide, iron sulfide and other minerals which possess ferromagnetic properties. Therefore, when high-temperature magma crystallizes, ferromagnetic minerals which have fallen below the Curie temperature record the magnetic field (geomagnetic field) to which they are exposed at that time. Magnetism recorded in this way is called “remanent magnetism.” Together with crystallization dating of rock, remanent magnetism has contributed greatly to the field of paleomagnetism. Table 1.
