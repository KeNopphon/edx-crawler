 Q1
 
    This figure shows a plate with the Euler pole and the Euler pole's equater. Which point is moving the fastest among the four points A to D ?
    

       A
       

       B
       

       C
       

       D
       
 Q2
 
    This figure shows an ocean ridge. Choose a formation age appropriate to each point A to D from the table below. (Formation ages of B and C are equal.)
    

       (Old) A, B=C, D (New)
       

       (Old) D, B=C, A (New)
       

       (Old) B=C, A, D (New)
       

       (Old) A, D, B=C (New)
       
 Q3
 
    Which geologic events are NOT derived from the work of subduction zone of plate?
    

       aurora
       

       typhoon(hurricane)
       

       the creation of volcanoes
       

       seismic activity
       

       orogenic activity
       
 Q4
 
    Why do volcanic activities occur at the subduction zone of plate? Choose the best explanation from the list below.
    

       The melting point is lowered by addition of water to the rocks.
       

       Seismic energy is caused by earthquakes occuring at the subduction zone.
       

       Friction energy occurs between plates and mantle.
       

       Gravity energy is released by subsidence of plates.
