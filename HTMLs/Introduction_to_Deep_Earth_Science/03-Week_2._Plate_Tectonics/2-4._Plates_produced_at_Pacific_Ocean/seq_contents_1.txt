Plates move independently while riding on the asthenosphere which moves below. There are three main types of boundaries where plates are in contact with each other. 1. Divergent boundary/boundaries According to plate tectonics theory, this is where plates are produced. It has been observed that plates move apart at divergent boundaries. The mid-ocean trenches which we studied earlier (2-2-1) are the most classical example of divergent boundaries. As an exception, these boundaries also exist in great rift zones on top of continental plates. The reason why divergent boundaries exist on top of continental plates will be explained in Week 4, when we will learn about movement occurring at even deeper areas of the Earth. 2. Convergent boundary/boundaries The divergent boundaries introduced above are boundaries where plates spread apart. In contrast, convergent boundaries are boundaries where plates move together. For further information on convergent boundaries, please refer to 2-4-3. 3. Transform boundary/boundaries The topography of ocean floor makes clear that oceanic ridges do not exist continuously, and are non-contiguous in some places. This is because strike-slip plate boundaries called "transform faults" exist approximately perpendicularly to oceanic ridges. This boundary is formed because the Earth is spherical. When a plate moves along a spherical shell, that movement is a rotational motion with many central axes as its shaft. When a plate performs such movements, its velocity differs depending on the distance from the central axis. For this reason, the migration velocity differs at different points, creating strike-slip faults. This is the strike-slip boundary. The another example of a transform fault can be seen in the San Andreas Fault in the west coast of the U.S.A.
