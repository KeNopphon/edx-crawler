Instructions for the final report This final report is to encourage you to explore deeper understanding of this course. You need to write and submit a report (200 - 400 words is the expected report length). You must write the report by yourself (this is an individual work).  You also need to assess three other learners' reports (your report will be also assessed by three students in this course).  Please refer "Guide to writing the Final Report" before you start writing the report.
