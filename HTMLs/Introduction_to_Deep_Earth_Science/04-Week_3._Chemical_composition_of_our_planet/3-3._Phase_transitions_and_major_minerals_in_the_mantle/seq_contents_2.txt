 In 3-3-2, we examined phases and phase diagrams. Here, we will examine it more deeply, along with details on phase transition, to apply it to geoscience.  As we saw in the phase diagram in 3-3-2, water becomes water vapor when heated to 100°C and ice when cooled to 0°C. However, it still remains H2O. Ice, water, and water vapor are in the phases of solid, liquid, and gas respectively. Its form changes with temperature. This is because the arrangement of molecules change. This phenomenon, where the arrangement of molecules change despite it remaining the same substance, is called phase transition. Does water always change to water vapor at 100 °C? For example, water boils at approximately 90°C at the summit of Mount Fuji (elevation 3776 m). We can conclude that there is another parameter of phase transition, in addition to temperature. That parameter is pressure. The atmospheric pressure is low at the summit of Mount Fuji, so the boiling point of water becomes lower than 100 °C. Furthermore, the temperature of the boiling point will also change if salt or ice is added to water, or if ethanol is used instead of water.  In other words, the point of occurrence of phase transition can be described using the three parameters of chemical composition, pressure, and temperature. (This corresponds to the three yields we urged caution about in 1-1-5.) Therefore, if the chemical composition is known, when either P or T is defined, the other parameter at the point of phase transition can be automatically determined. This is a phase diagram of water. The vertical axis is temperature and the horizontal axis is pressure.  For example, carbon can exist as graphite or as diamond, though they are both solids. Even solids of the same substance are considered different phases, if the arrangement of molecules are different. Such differences in solids with the same chemical composition but different crystal structures is called polymorphism. This change from one form of polymorphism to another is also called phase transition, in addition to transition of states, such as from solid to liquid.  The video below is a documentation of phase transition from liquid to ice VI. Phase transition was induced by changing only the pressure, not the temperature.  The phase transition happening inside the mantle is like this phase transition from ice to ice: phase transition from a solid to a solid.  In 1-4-3, we examined various layers inside our planet. These layers are formed by the phase transition of peridotite, the major metal of the upper mantle, due to the changes in temperature and pressure corresponding to the increase in depth. So why is there a surface reflecting seismic waves in locations, for example, where phase transition is occurring? The velocity of seismic waves is expressed below, as touched on in detail in 1-3-4. \(V_p=\sqrt{\frac{K + \frac{4}{3} \mu}{\rho}}\)　, \(V_s=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\rho}}\)  When phase transition occurs, even though the chemical composition remains the same, density ρ as well as modulus of elasticity K and μ change greatly. As a result, the velocity of seismic waves change greatly with discontinuity at layer boundaries. Thus, wave-reflecting surfaces are formed according to the principle of reflection which was described in 1-3-5. By observing this, we came to understand the onion structure of the Earth's interior. *If you require a more detailed explanation, review 1-3-4 and 1-3-5.
