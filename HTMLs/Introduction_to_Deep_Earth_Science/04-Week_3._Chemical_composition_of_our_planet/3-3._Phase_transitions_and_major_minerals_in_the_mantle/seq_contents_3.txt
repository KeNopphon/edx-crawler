I provided information about phase diagrams for olivine, the main mineral in peridotites, in 3-3-2. Let’s go over it one more time. Olivine’s phase transition is as shown below.    How much of the mantle might these account for? A diagram that gives their distribution together with their ratios is shown below. It can be seen that around half the upper mantle and most of the lower mantle are olivine minerals that undergo high pressure phase transitions. The reason that other minerals exist is that the Earth’s interior contains other elements such as Ca and Al, for example. These come together to create separate minerals. Additionally, minerals called pyroxene and majorite (garnet) exist in abundance in the upper mantle. Calcium perovskite exsists in lower mantle. These are also silicate minerals (having the structure of SiO2), but elements other than Mg and Fe find their way in. It can be seen that the principal minerals’ proportion is high (from the point of view of those of us on the Earth’s surface who see all kinds of minerals), and I hope that you have gained an understanding that the variety of minerals in the Earth’s interior is actually uncomplicated. Further study: The ratios of all the minerals are as follows. Put your cursor over the graph below and click to jump to that mineral’s Wikipedia page. Additionally, in this course on Deep Earth Science the term Perovskite being used refers to the Silicate Perovskite.
