 Q4
 
    This diagram plots the ratio of elements in the chemical composition of meteorites and that of the solar atmosphere. To plot hydrogen(Note that hydrogen is a volatile element) in this diagram, which of the following locations should it be?
    

       1
       

       2
       

       3
       
 Q5
 
    How can the chemical composition of the nonvolatile elements in the core be estimated conceptionally? (the chemical composition of the nonvolatile elements in the core)
    

       = (chemical composition of Earth as a whole as estimated from meteorites) + (chemical composition of mantle) - (chemical composition of crust)
       

       = (chemical composition of Earth as a whole as estimated from meteorites)
       

       = (chemical composition of Earth as a whole as estimated from meteorites) - (chemical composition of mantle) - (chemical composition of crust)
       

       = 2 Ã— (chemical composition of mantle) - (chemical composition of crust)
