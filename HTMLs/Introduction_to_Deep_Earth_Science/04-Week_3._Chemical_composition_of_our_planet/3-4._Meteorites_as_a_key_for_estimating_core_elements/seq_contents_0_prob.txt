    Why can it be predicted that the chemical composition of Earth as a whole generally has a high degree of coincidence with those of meteorites?
    

       Because the chemical composition of the solar atmosphere and that of meteorites have a high degree of coincidence, and Earth is between the sun and the asteroid belt
       

       Because the chemical composition of the solar atmosphere and that of Earth's atmosphere have a high degree of coincidence, and Earth is between the sun and the asteroid belt
       

       Because the chemical composition of Earth's atmosphere and that of meteorites have a high degree of coincidence, and Earth is between the sun and the asteroid belt
       
 Quiz b
 
    Why is the core predicted to contain light elements?
    

       Because the actual core density as learned by observing seismic waves is lower than that of a core hypothesized to contain only light elements
       

       Because light elements cannot escape from the core
       

       Because the core contains elements heavier than iron, and light elements are necessary to balance the weight
       

       Because the actual core density as learned by observing seismic waves is lower than that of pure iron
