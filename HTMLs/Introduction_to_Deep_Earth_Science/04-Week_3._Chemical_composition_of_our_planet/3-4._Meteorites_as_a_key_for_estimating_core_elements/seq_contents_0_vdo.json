            "Lastly, let's consider the core. The core starts below 2,900km",
            "from the surface of the Earth, so we cannot directly collect the materials",
            "in the core here at the surface. Because of this,",
            "in order to determine the chemical composition of the core,",
            "it is necessary to use other circumstantial evidence.",
            "The most trustworthy evidence we have is the chemical composition of meteorites.",
            "Meteorites originate from a certain location. It is well known that",
            "meteorites come from the asteroid belt that exists between Mars and Jupiter.",
            "By examining the chemical composition of meteorites, we know that they actually match with the",
            "chemical composition of the solar atmosphere as you can see in",
            "this picture. Therefore, because the chemical compositions",
            "of the solar atmosphere and that of asteroids are the same,",
            "we can assume that the chemical composition of the Earth, which",
            "is located between them, is the same. However, it is important to remember that",
            "the argument I just mentioned does not apply to volatile constituents.",
            "First, let's calculate the chemical composition of the Earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core",
            "without taking into account the volatile elements. We are basing this",
            "on the assumption that the average chemical composition",
            "of the Earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crust, mantle, and core, is the same as the chemical composition of",
            "primitive meteorites. If we subtract",
            "the chemical compositions of the Earth's crust and mantle",
            "we will be left with the chemical composition of the core,",
            "which contains iron, nickel, and silicon. But, is this reality the actual chemical composition?",
            "Well, no, we are not quite finished yet. We need to include the volatile elements that",
            "I mentioned previously.",
            "How do we know the actual composition of the core?",
            "Let me explain using this figure. Here, the horizontal axis is the depth, and",
            "the vertical axis represents the density. The one on top is the density of pure iron,",
            "and next is the density of alloy that contains iron and silicon.",
            "Lastly, this is the actual core density acquired from seismic observation.",
            "You can see that the actual core density is much lower than that of pure iron",
            "and still lower than the alloy containing 6 wt.% silicon suggested from the composition",
            "of meteorite. To account for such low core density,",
            "there must be a certain amount of light elements contained that are volatile constituents.",
            "People have been arguing over this for the last 60 years,",
            "but it is still a subject of debate among researchers."
