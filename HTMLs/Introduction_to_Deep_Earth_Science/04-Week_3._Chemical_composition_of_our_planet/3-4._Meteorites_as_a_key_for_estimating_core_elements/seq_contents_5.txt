We have looked at the Earth’s elemental structure up to this point. Now, what kinds of elements might make up the other planets in the solar system? I would like to briefly provide information about the solar system’s other planets here. There are three types of planets. These revolve around the sun in nearly circular orbits and, starting with the closest, are terrestrial planets, gas giants, and ice giants. (1) Terrestrial planets:Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars Planets composed mainly of refractory substances such as rock and metal (2) Gas giants:Jupiter and Saturn Planets with low density and huge sizes, primarily made up of gases  (3) Ice giants:Uranus and Neptune Huge planets composed mainly of water, methane, and ammonia that have solidified into ice  The respective planets’ data are shown below  I would like anyone who has additional interest to refer to the following sites:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Systemhttp://solarsystem.nasa.gov/  Further study: Humanity was recently able to view Pluto’s form for the first time thanks to NASA’s New Horizons mission.
