I will sum up the logic shown in the video.  First, the Earth’s chemical composition is presumed to be as follows:  Next, the entire Earth’s chemical composition is represented as follows:  That being the case, the core’s chemical composition, which cannot be understood well from the surface, would be derived from (1) and (2) as follows:   According to these calculations, there is a theory that there is silicon in the Earth’s core along with Fe and Ni. (The situation is that debates regarding the existence of silicon are still underway.)  Next, meteorite’s chemical composition also matches the solar atmosphere’s chemical composition to a relative degree, but not necessarily when it comes to volatile constituents. There is also a possibility that volatiles are present in the core.  Density deficit in the earth’s core  One of the famous geophysicists, Birch revealed that the density of the earth’s outer and inner core is lower than pure iron from seismologic studies. It is around 10 % in liquid outer core and 5% in solid inner core. However, which light element(s) lead to the density deficit is still an open question. Several light element(s) such as Si, H, O, C, S are proposed as candidates of light elements of the earth’s core and many experimental or theoretical results are provided (3-4-4).
