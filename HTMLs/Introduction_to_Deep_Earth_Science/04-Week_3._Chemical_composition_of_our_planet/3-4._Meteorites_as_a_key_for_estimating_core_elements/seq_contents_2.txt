Meteorites are rocks which fall to the Earth from outer space. A distinctive feature of meteorites is the black glass caused by frictional heat when the meteorite enters the atmosphere. In addition to meteorites which were witnessed falling to the Earth, many meteorites have been discovered during surveys of deserts and Antarctica. Meteorites collected on the Earth are composed of metal and stone. Depending on the quantitative ratio of these materials, meteorites are divided into the three main classifications of stony meteorites, stony-iron meteorites, and iron meteorites. Stony meteorites are further divided into two classifications based on the presence of distinctive granules called “chondrules”. Stony meteorites which contain chondrules are called “chondrites,” while those which do not contain chondrules are called “achondrites.” A summary of these classifications is shown in figure below.  When comparing the layer structure (crust-mantle-core) inside of the Earth with the constituents and chemical composition of meteorites, achondrites correspond to the crust-mantle of the lithosphere, iron meteorites correspond to the metal core, and stony-iron meteorites correspond to the core-mantle boundary. Therefore, it is believed that these meteorites flew from corresponding layers of a celestial body which possesses a layered structure similar to the Earth (Figure 5). Conversely, chondrites possess a chemical composition which is similar to the sun (excluding highly volatile elements) and contain chondrules which are thought to have been formed at the beginning of the solar system. Accordingly, it can be inferred that chondrites correspond to undifferentiated substances which existed before the Earth formed its current layered structure.
